# CHATBOT-ToAnyURL
I did an attempt to make a chatbot in which we can just replace the URL to which the CHATBOT would answer the questions. I have used langchain community, transformer model, gradio for UI, faiss to store vectors etc

This one is a general use chatbot which can answer any general questions and interact like a normal human.

While i this ,We can replace the URL with our desired website or app , to which the chatbot could answer the questions.
